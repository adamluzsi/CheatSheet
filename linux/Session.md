`~/.xinitrc` is executed by [`xinit`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinit), which is usually invoked via `startx`. This program is executed after logging in: first you log in on a text console, then you start the GUI with `startx`. The role of `.xinitrc` is to start the GUI part of the session, typically by setting some GUI-related settings such as key bindings (with `xmodmap` or `xkbcomp`), X resources (with `xrdb`), etc., and to launch a session manager or a window manager (possibly as part of a desktop environment).

`~/.xsession` is executed when you log in in graphical mode (on a [display manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_display_manager_(program_type))) and the display manager invokes the “custom” session type. (With the historical display manager xdm, `.xsession` is always executed, but with modern display managers that give the user a choice of session type, you usually need to pick “custom” for `.xsession` to run.) Its role is both to set login-time parameters (such as environment variables) and to start the GUI session. A typical `.xsession` is

    #!/bin/sh
    . ~/.profile
    . ~/.xinitrc
    

`~/.xsessionrc` is executed on Debian (and derivatives such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.) by the X startup scripts on a GUI login, for all session types and (I think) from all display managers. It's also executed from `startx` if the user doesn't have a `.xinitrc`, because in that case `startx` falls back on the same session startup scripts that are used for GUI login. It's executed relatively early, after loading resources but before starting any program such as a key agent, a D-Bus daemon, etc. It typically sets variables that can be used by later startup scripts. It doesn't have any official documentation that I know of, you have to dig into the source to see what works.

`.xinitrc` and `.xsession` are historical features of the X11 Window system so they should be available and have a similar behavior on all Unix systems. On the other hand, `.xsessionrc` is a Debian feature and distributions that are not based on Debian don't have it unless they've implemented something similar.

`.xprofile` is very similar to `.xsessionrc`, but it's part of the session startup script of GDM (the GNOME display manager), so it's only read if you log in with GDM.
